# Google Photos Cleaner View

Hides photos from the main Google Photos view which are known to be in an album.  Add items to the album cache by scrolling through your albums and letting the images load into Chrome.  Click the browser icon to disable/enable the addon.

## Instructions

As you browse your Google Photo Albums, the plugin will record each photo that is loaded and then hide duplicate photos from the main (non-album) view. Album photos must be loaded into the browser to be cached.  A photo with a red border has not yet been cached.  A photo with a green border has.

## Known Issues

Deleting or removing a photo from an Album will not remove it from the plugin's cache, leaving it hidden on the main view. Clearing the plugin's cache is the lazy work-around for the time being.
